## üß† Project Overview

Apple1JS is a browser-based Apple 1 computer emulator built with TypeScript/React. Features cycle-accurate 6502 CPU emulation, authentic CRT display with phosphor effects, and full debugging capabilities. The architecture separates emulation logic (Web Worker) from UI for performance.

## üß† Claude Instructions

**Phase 1 ‚Äì Analysis & Proposal**

- Document findings in `@docs/architecture_analysis.md` or `@docs/user_experience_analysis.md`
- **CRITICAL**: Wait for "‚úÖ Phase 1 Approved" - prevents wasted work and ensures alignment

**Phase 2 ‚Äì Implementation**

- Follow approved plan exactly - deviations require discussion
- Run tests before/after changes to ensure no regression
- Update `src/version.ts` ONLY after all tasks complete (semantic versioning)
- Run full CI pipeline: `yarn run lint && yarn run type-check && yarn run test:ci`
- Mark completed items with ‚úÖ in analysis docs for tracking

**Key Principles**

- `IInspectableComponent` enables debugger integration for any component
- UI logging preserves history and aids debugging (no console.log)
- src/progs contains original Apple 1 code - read-only for historical accuracy
- Version bump signals release readiness

## üõ† Development Commands

- `yarn run dev` / `build` / `preview`
- `yarn run test` / `test:ci`
- `yarn run lint` / `type-check` / `format`

## üß± Architecture Overview

- **src/core/**: Emulation engine - 6502 CPU, memory subsystem, clock, bus, PIA 6820
    - Pure TypeScript, no UI dependencies for testability
    - Implements `IInspectableComponent` for runtime introspection
- **src/apple1/**: System integration layer
    - Web Worker isolation prevents UI blocking during emulation
    - Message-based communication via WORKER_MESSAGES protocol
    - Contains original ROM/program data
- **src/components/**: React UI layer
    - CRT display with authentic phosphor rendering
    - Integrated debugger (memory viewer, disassembler, CPU state)
    - Component inspector shows real-time system state
- **src/styles/**: Design token system for consistent theming
- **src/services/**: Cross-cutting concerns (logging, state management)

## üß© Key Architectural Patterns

**Memory Architecture** (Apple 1 authentic layout):

- `$0000-$0FFF`: 4KB RAM (includes zero page, stack at $0100-$01FF)
- `$D010-$D013`: PIA 6820 for keyboard/display I/O
- `$E000-$EFFF`: Extended RAM for BASIC interpreter
- `$FF00-$FFFF`: WOZ Monitor ROM

**State Management**:

- `EmulatorState` captures complete system state for save/restore
- Web Worker maintains authoritative state, UI reflects via messages
- Prevents race conditions and ensures consistency

**Component Inspection**:

- `IInspectableComponent` provides `inspect()` method returning debug info
- Enables real-time debugging without performance impact
- Tree structure mirrors hardware architecture

**Performance Considerations**:

- Worker isolation prevents UI blocking during emulation
- Message batching reduces overhead
- TypeScript strict mode catches errors at compile time

## üöÄ Testing & Quality Requirements

**Before ANY commit**:

```bash
yarn run lint && yarn run type-check && yarn run test:ci
```

**Coverage Requirements**:

- Core emulation (CPU, memory, bus): ‚â• 90% line/branch coverage
- New features: Must include tests demonstrating functionality
- Bug fixes: Must include regression test

**Why These Matter**:

- TypeScript strict mode catches ~40% of bugs at compile time
- Tests ensure emulation accuracy (critical for vintage software)
- Linting maintains code consistency across contributors

## üî¢ Version Bumps

- **Major**: Breaking changes
- **Minor**: New features
- **Patch**: Bug fixes

## üé® Design System & Colors

**Centralized Design Tokens** (`src/styles/tokens.ts`):
All colors flow from this single source to ensure consistency and enable theming.

**Color Categories & Purpose**:

- **Phosphor**: CRT authenticity (green glow variations)
- **Data Types**: Visual distinction for debugging
    - `data-address` (blue): Memory locations
    - `data-value` (green): Data/registers
    - `data-flag` (amber): CPU flags
- **Semantic**: System status at a glance
- **Component**: Hardware type identification in inspector
- **Surface/Border**: Visual hierarchy through depth

**Critical Exception - CRT Display**:
CRT components use hardcoded colors for historical accuracy:

- `#68D391` for character rendering (matches period CRTs)
- `#0A3A3A` for background (authentic phosphor coating)
  These are intentionally outside the token system.

**Implementation Pattern**:

```typescript
// Modern components
import { designTokens } from '@/styles/tokens';
const color = designTokens.colors.data.address;

// Tailwind (when tokens not available)
<div className="text-data-address" />
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Debugger System (July 2025 Implementation)

**DebuggerLayout** (`src/components/DebuggerLayout.tsx`):

- Tabbed interface replacing previous cramped layout
- Three views: Overview (CPU/Stack), Memory, Disassembly
- Maintains state across tab switches for workflow continuity

**MemoryViewer** (`src/components/MemoryViewer.tsx`):

- Hex editor showing 768 bytes (48 rows √ó 16 bytes)
- Address input with Enter to navigate (like disassembler)
- Arrow navigation with smart scrolling (up=bottom, down=top)
- ASCII representation sidebar
- Ready for edit functionality (infrastructure complete)

**StackViewer** (`src/components/StackViewer.tsx`):

- Real-time 6502 stack visualization ($0100-$01FF)
- Shows active portion only (SP to $FF)
- Usage indicator with color coding (green/yellow/red)
- Current SP position highlighted

**Key Design Decisions**:

- Tabs prevent information overload while keeping tools accessible
- 500ms refresh rate balances responsiveness with performance
- Consistent color coding via design tokens aids quick scanning
- Memory viewer size (768 bytes) fits common use cases without scrolling

## üìç Current State & Recent Work (July 2025)

**Recently Completed**:

- ‚úÖ **Integrated Debugger**: Replaced cramped layout with tabbed interface after user feedback
    - Previous: All debug info crammed in one view (unusable)
    - Current: Clean tabs for Overview/Memory/Disassembly
    - Key learning: Users need focused views, not information density
- ‚úÖ **Memory Viewer Fixes**:
    - Added address input (was missing, unlike disassembler)
    - Smart scrolling for navigation continuity
    - 768-byte view based on typical debugging sessions
- ‚úÖ **UI Standardization**: Design tokens ensure consistency
    - Except CRT display (intentionally authentic)

**Next Priorities** (from user_experience_analysis.md):

- **Execution Control**: Step/breakpoints/run-to-cursor (infrastructure exists)
- **Memory Search**: Find bytes/strings in memory
- **Watch Expressions**: Monitor memory/register values
- **Hardware Authenticity**: Keyboard sounds, power-on sequence

**Known Issues**:

- Memory editing UI ready but write operations not implemented in worker
- Some linting warnings in user_experience_analysis.md (formatting)

## üìö Key Concepts

- **PIA 6820**: Peripheral Interface Adapter - handles keyboard input and display output
- **WOZ Monitor**: Steve Wozniak's original ROM monitor program
- **IInspectableComponent**: Our interface enabling any component to provide debug info
- **Design Tokens**: Centralized theme system preventing color chaos
- **Web Worker**: Isolates CPU emulation from UI thread for smooth performance
