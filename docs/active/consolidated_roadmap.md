# Apple1JS Consolidated Roadmap

> **Purpose**: This document consolidates all todos and roadmap items from across the project into a single, organized plan.
> **Priority System**: 🛑 Critical (test stability) | 🔴 High (regression risk) | 🟡 Medium (core features) | 🟢 Low (refinements)
> **Last Updated**: July 2025 | **Current Version**: 4.21.0

## 🛑 Critical Priority - Test Stability & Core Issues

These items directly impact test stability or could cause regressions if not handled properly.

### 1. FilteredDebugData Type System Fix

**Status**: 🚧 In Progress  
**Risk**: Type assertions (`as any`) are fragile and could break
**Location**: `src/apple1/WorkerAPI.ts`

**Tasks**:

- Remove workaround for `_PERF_DATA` object preservation
- Update `FilteredDebugData` type to support nested objects properly
- Update all consumers to handle new type structure
- Ensure backward compatibility

**Why Critical**: Type workarounds can break unexpectedly and cause cascading failures

---

### 2. Worker Communication Race Conditions

**Status**: ❌ Not Started  
**Risk**: Async timing issues could cause intermittent test failures
**Location**: `DisassemblerPaginated` component

**Issues**:

- `actualVisibleRows` set async with requestAnimationFrame
- `lines` might fetch before row calculation completes
- Multiple resize events could overlap

**Why Critical**: Race conditions cause flaky tests that are hard to debug

---

### 3. Component Unmount Safety

**Status**: ❌ Not Started  
**Risk**: Memory leaks and React warnings
**Location**: Multiple components with timeouts

**Tasks**:

- Add cleanup checks before setState calls
- Handle 150ms timeout errors if component unmounts
- Create reusable unmount-safe hooks

**Why Critical**: Unmount errors pollute test output and can cause false failures

---

## 🔴 High Priority - Core Functionality & Architecture

These items improve core functionality without significant regression risk.

### 4. Split CPU6502.ts Module

**Status**: 📋 Planning  
**Size**: 2583 lines, 68KB - exceeds context window limits

**Proposed Structure**:

```text
cpu6502/
├── opcodes.ts      # Opcode table and definitions
├── instructions.ts # Instruction implementations
├── addressing.ts   # Addressing mode implementations  
├── core.ts        # Main CPU class
└── debug.ts       # Debugging functionality
```

**Why High**: Better maintainability, easier testing, reduced context size

---

### 5. Base Classes for Common Patterns

**Status**: ❌ Not Started  
**From**: CLAUDE.md roadmap

**Tasks**:

- Extract worker state sync patterns into reusable hooks
- Create `useWorkerState<T>` hook
- Standardize error handling patterns
- Document common patterns

**Why High**: Reduces code duplication and prevents inconsistent implementations

---

### 6. Integration Tests for Worker Communication

**Status**: ❌ Not Started  
**From**: CLAUDE.md roadmap

**Tasks**:

- Test full flow: CPU → Worker → UI
- Test error scenarios and recovery
- Test performance under load
- Add Comlink-specific integration tests

**Why High**: Current unit tests don't catch worker communication issues

---

### 7. Comprehensive Error Handling

**Status**: ❌ Not Started  
**From**: CLAUDE.md roadmap

**Tasks**:

- Add error boundaries to key components
- Implement graceful degradation
- Add user-friendly error messages
- Create error recovery mechanisms

**Why High**: Prevents crashes and improves user experience

---

## 🟡 Medium Priority - Enhanced Features

These enhance functionality with moderate complexity and risk.

### 8. Memory Search Capability

**Status**: ❌ Not Started  
**User Request**: Frequently requested feature

**Tasks**:

- Add search bar UI to MemoryViewerPaginated
- Implement worker message for memory search
- Add results highlighting and navigation
- Support both hex and ASCII search modes

---

### 9. Conditional Breakpoints

**Status**: ❌ Not Started  
**Description**: Break when conditions met (e.g., "A=$FF")

**Tasks**:

- Extend breakpoint UI to accept conditions
- Add condition parser and evaluator in worker
- Store conditions with breakpoints
- Add UI for managing conditions

---

### 10. Watch Expressions

**Status**: ❌ Not Started  
**Description**: Monitor values without navigation

**Tasks**:

- Create WatchPanel component
- Add worker support for monitoring
- Real-time updates during execution
- Persist watch list in state

---

### 11. Step Over Functionality

**Status**: ❌ Not Started  
**Location**: `EmulationContext.tsx:149`

**Note**: UI exists but worker implementation missing

---

### 12. Console.log Migration

**Status**: 🚧 Multiple files need update

**Files to Update**:

- WorkerCommunicationService.ts
- StatePersistenceService.ts  
- Error.tsx
- errors.ts

**Action**: Replace with LoggingService

---

## 🟢 Low Priority - Refinements & Polish

These are nice-to-have improvements with minimal risk.

### 13. Performance Optimizations

#### React Context Memoization

**From**: CLAUDE.md Phase 2

- Optimize EmulationContext
- Add proper memoization
- Reduce unnecessary re-renders

#### Variable Instruction Size Handling

**Status**: ✅ Partially Complete

- Scroll navigation now instruction-aware
- Could optimize fetch buffer sizes

#### Safety Limit Review

- 100-line limit in disassembly might truncate
- Consider dynamic limit based on viewport

---

### 14. UI/UX Enhancements

#### Audio Package

**Status**: ❌ Not Started

- Keyboard click sounds
- System beep for errors
- Volume controls
- Web Audio API implementation

#### Visual Enhancements
