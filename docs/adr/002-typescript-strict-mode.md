# ADR-002: TypeScript Strict Mode

**Status**: Implemented

**Date**: 2024-12

## Context

TypeScript strict mode provides better type safety but was already enabled in the project configuration.

## Decision

Maintain strict mode configuration with all strict checks enabled, including:

- `strict: true` (enables all strict type checking options)
- `noImplicitAny: true`
- `strictNullChecks: true`
- `noUnusedLocals: true`
- `noUnusedParameters: true`

## Consequences

### Positive
- Catches more errors at compile time
- Better IDE support
- Safer refactoring

### Negative
- None significant, as the codebase was already compliant

## Implementation

See `tsconfig.json` for the complete TypeScript configuration.
