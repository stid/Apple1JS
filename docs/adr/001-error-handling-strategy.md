# ADR-001: Error Handling Strategy

**Status**: Implemented

**Date**: 2024-12

## Context

The codebase had inconsistent error handling with some components throwing errors, others logging, and some failing silently. This made debugging difficult and behavior unpredictable.

## Decision

Implement a centralized error handling system with:

- Custom error classes extending from `EmulatorError` base class
- Component-specific error types (BusError, CPUError, MemoryError, StateError)
- Centralized `ErrorHandler` utility for consistent error processing
- Integration with existing LoggingService for error reporting

## Consequences

### Positive

- Consistent error handling across all components
- Better debugging with clear error context
- Type-safe error handling

### Negative

- Slight overhead from error object creation
- Requires updating all error throw statements

## Implementation

See `src/core/errors.ts` for the error class hierarchy and `ErrorHandler` utility.
