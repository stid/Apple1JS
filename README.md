# Apple 1 Javascript Emulator

*<https://stid.github.io/Apple1JS/>*

NodeJS/Javascript Apple 1 Emulator, include initial abstraction of 6820 and other core components.

Project was build to sketch the hybrid HW version published here: <https://github.com/stid/APPLE-1-ReplicaDue>

6502.js is based on:
<https://github.com/Torlus/6502.js>

I use this project as some sort of on the edge sandbox/playground. It give me an excuse to play with the latest technologies as I improve the emulator itself.

## NODEJS

You can execute the emulator in via nodejs, assuming proper version of node is installed in your system.

Under this repository root:

1. Install required packages via: `yarn install`
2. Start in dev mode via: `yarn raw_start`

If you want to build the node version:

1. Build node package via: `yarn build-node`
2. Execute node package via: `yarn start`

## BROWSER

You can build & execute a web version visible inside your browser. This use a simple server behind, Web Workers to execute the core and a simple React component to render the monitor.

Under this repository root:

1. Install required packages via: `yarn install`
2. Build via `yarn build`
3. Start the simple web server via: `yarn server-start`
4. Follow the info and load the related app on your browser (usually <http://127.0.0.1:8080>)
