# 🤖 AI Usage Statement

This project leverages agentic AI tools to accelerate development, experimentation, and code quality. All AI-assisted contributions are reviewed, curated, and integrated by a human developer to ensure correctness, maintainability, and alignment with project goals.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Claude Console** (Anthropic)
  - Used for: code generation, refactoring, documentation drafting, and test scaffolding
- **Other AI Assistants** (as applicable)
  - e.g., GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, etc.

## 🧠 Philosophy

AI is used as a collaborator — not a replacement. It helps:

- Reduce boilerplate and repetitive tasks
- Explore alternative implementations
- Accelerate prototyping and iteration
- Improve documentation and readability

## ✅ Human Oversight

Every AI-generated or AI-assisted contribution is:

- Reviewed for correctness and security
- Edited for clarity and consistency
- Integrated with full awareness of project context

## 📌 Transparency in Commits

Where applicable, commit messages may include tags like:

- `[claude]` — AI-assisted
- `[human-reviewed AI]` — AI-generated, human-curated

## 📣 Why This Matters

As part of a broader effort to explore and model responsible AI adoption in software engineering, this project aims to:

- Demonstrate practical use of agentic AI tools
- Encourage open discussion about AI in development workflows
- Share learnings with the community
